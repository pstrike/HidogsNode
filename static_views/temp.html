                        <p><strong><u>Listings</u></strong></p>
                        <p>As a Host, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Host-Provided Services to be listed, including, but not limited to, your place and pets (if relevant), the type and availability of the Host-Provided Services, pricing and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site. Other Members will be able to book your Host-Provided Services via the Site based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Member books your Host-Provided Services, the price for such Host-Provided Services may not be altered. DogVacay reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove, edit or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that DogVacay, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Certain Host Obligations (Including to Comply with Applicable Laws and Obtain All Necessary Licenses and Permits)</u></strong></p>
                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the provision of any Host-Provided Services in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, laws governing the treatment of animals and any federal, state or local permitting or licensing requirements, and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties.  In addition, you agree to comply with all applicable requirements of your insurance policies covering any of your property or operations.</p>
                        <p>EACH HOST IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING ALL PERMITS, LICENSES AND OTHER PERMISSIONS REQUIRED TO OFFER OR PROVIDE ANY PET BOARDING SERVICES OR OTHER HOST-PROVIDED SERVICES AND DOGVACAY ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR A HOST'S FAILURE TO OBTAIN SUCH PERMITS, LICENSES OR PERMISSIONS OR OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS.</p>
                        <p>You understand and agree that DogVacay is neither an insurer nor a contracting agent for you as a Host. If a Member purchases any of your Host-Provided Services, any agreement you enter into with such Member is between you and the Member and DogVacay is not a party thereto.

You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.</p>
                        <p>DogVacay recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Host-Provided Services. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Host-Provided Services carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of pets with respect to which you provide any Host-Provided Services.  Please note that the failure to advise your insurance company (whether for Homeowner’s, Renter’s or other insurance) about your activities relating to Host-Provided Services may void your coverage or result in denial of an otherwise covered claim.</p>
                        <p>Each Host understands the fact that DogVacay does not offer any human medical coverage for bodily harm or injury that may result from a Guest pet. DogVacay will not reimburse for any medical bills, transportation or loss of wages as a result of the injury. The Host will also assume full responsibility for each and every person that enters their residence, and understands that DogVacay will not offer any medical coverage to these visitors regardless of their affiliation to the Host (visitor, partner, relative, friend, etc.), as they are not considered to be a "Third-Party" by our Terms of Service. Any visitor who brings a pet to a Host's home that is not booked through a Vacay will not be eligible for any coverage under DogVacay’s Insurance Program.</p>

                        <p id="exclusions"><strong><u>Host Insurance Program</u></strong></p>
                        <p>We offer the following protections during a stay booked with DogVacay. Subject to the limitations, exclusions and conditions described more fully on our Host Insurance Program page located at <a href="/insurance" target="_blank">http://dogvacay.com/Insurance_program</a> (the "Insurance Program Information Page", and such program described therein, the “Insurance Program”), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, we will include Hosts and Members in our Insurance Program described on the Insurance Program Information Page.   To the extent permissible by applicable law in your jurisdiction, DogVacay reserves the right to modify or terminate the Insurance Program, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice. If DogVacay terminates the Insurance Program in accordance with the foregoing, DogVacay will provide you with notice of such termination and DogVacay will continue to process claims under the Insurance Program filed prior to the effective date of termination. If DogVacay modifies the Insurance Program, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification and DogVacay will continue to process all claims filed prior to the effective date of the modification. Such modifications may include, without limitation, conditions on your eligibility under the Insurance Program.

                        <p><strong><u>Pet Vet Care</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Please note that, without limitation, the Insurance Program does not cover issues that may arise with respect to pets with pre-existing conditions or any of the following conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a pet has or had any condition, whether diagnosed by your veterinarian or not, before, during or after a Vacay, it is considered pre-existing. This can include: respiratory infections, urinary tract/bladder infections, blood disorders, vomiting, feline immunodeficiency or leukemia virus, diarrhea, glaucoma and other gastrointestinal disorders.</li>
                            <li>If a pet has been diagnosed with a disease of an anatomical area where the underlying cause was undetermined any diagnosis of the same area would not be covered. For example, gastritis and colitis are both general diagnoses of inflammation, but do not get at the cause of the disorder.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If your pet has had any of the following conditions prior to staying with a Host as part of such Host’s Host-Provided Services (a “Vacay”) or your pet is diagnosed with any of these conditions <strong>our Insurance Program will not apply:</strong></p>
                        <p>Any orthopedic condition including but not limited to luxating patellas, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and OCD, orthopedic illness or injury on the opposite side of a prior injury.  Chronic conditions including, but not limited to, allergies, cancer, diabetes, lipomas or skin lumps, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, urinary or bladder crystals or blockage. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breed-specific conditions: A genetic condition is caused by a defect in the underlying genes that are transmitted to a puppy or kitten from its parents. These gene defects run in families and some breeds have many more of them than other breeds, hence the term breed-specific condition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: Treatment for many breed-specific conditions requires corrective surgery and some are also chronic conditions that require ongoing care. Among the most common breed-specific conditions are: hip and elbow dysplasia (common in German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Great Danes and other large/giant breed dogs), patellar luxation (common in Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Boston Terriers, Cavalier King Charles and other toy/small breed dogs), interverterbral disc disease (IVDD) Spinal (ruptured, herniated) disc issues (common in Dachshunds, Bassett Hounds, French Bulldogs, Pomeranians, Corgis, Pugs and other chondrodystrophic breeds), cancer, allergies.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chronic conditions: Chronic conditions persist or last for several months (often for years). They generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication, nor do they just disappear. Common conditions include: allergies, cancer, diabetes, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), Addison's disease, Cushing's disease, dry eyes (KCS), epilepsy, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, Orthopedic issues such as arthritis, IVDD &amp; cruciate ligament tears. Non-medical related treatment (professional training, etc) is not eligible for coverage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Guest loss of wages or incidental expenses due to required follow up medical treatment for their pet is not eligible for coverage. DogVacay is not liable for any costs incurred by a Guest or Host in the event that they need to adjust and/or cancel travel plans due to unforeseen circumstances (i.e. hotel fees, plane tickets, gas for travel, etc).</p>
                        <p>It is the Host's and Member's responsibility to determine whether the guest pet has any of the foregoing conditions, and DogVacay will have no liability or responsibility for any issues that may arise from the foregoing conditions. If any medical care is required to be provided to the guest pet and such care is covered by the Insurance Program, the Member or Host, as applicable, will be responsible for paying the applicable $250 out of pocket expense, as described on the Insurance Program Information Page. If you believe that any incident is covered under the Insurance Program, you must provide us with written notice of the incident and your belief that it is covered by the Insurance Program, along with all material documentation available to you evidencing the foregoing (e.g., invoices and veterinary (DVM) notes from the initial veterinary examination), within seven (7) days after the end date of the corresponding Vacay. For example, if the end date of the Vacay were January 1, 2015, DogVacay must be notified of the incident and provided all such documentation by no later than January 8, 2015 in order for any such incident to be potentially eligible under our Insurance Program.</p>
                        <p>In addition, and without limitation, the Insurance Program does not cover Meet-N-Greets or any incidents arising from a Meet-N-Greet.</p>

                        <p><i>For Emergency Medical Situations Involving a Member's Pet:</i></p>
                        <p>Members should ensure that the Host is provided with contact information to reach the Member in the event an emergency medical situation arises involving a Member's pet. Members and Hosts acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any situation arises where the Member's pet is required to receive emergency veterinary care while in the care or custody of the Host, the Host must first contact DogVacay 24/7 support at 855-364-8222, and DogVacay will determine whether emergency veterinary care is required.  If DogVacay determines that such veterinary care is required, DogVacay shall make reasonable efforts during DogVacay's normal business hours to contact the Member to notify the Member of the situation.  If the Member or the Member’s emergency contact cannot be reached following reasonable efforts, Member authorizes Host and DogVacay to authorize care on his/her behalf in order to promptly treat Member's pet. Members acknowledge and agree that the costs of any such treatment for emergency medical situations is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Member and that Member's credit card may be billed for any amount to reimburse costs incurred by the Host or DogVacay attendant thereto. In certain circumstances, Member may seek reimbursements of these costs or a portion thereof through the Insurance Program. Additional information regarding these plans can be found on our Insurance Program Information Page.</p>
                        <p>In the event that a Host or Member's pet does require medical treatment as the result of a Vacay, DogVacay will not offer any additional coverage should that pet require treatment for further damage as the result of owner negligence. For example, if a pet is to have surgery and the owner does not allow it the proper amount of time to rest and heal (especially if instructed by a vet to keep the pet confined to bed rest for a duration of time), DogVacay will not be responsible for any additional treatment that may result from further injury.</p>
                        <p><i>For Flea/Tick Situations Involving a Member's Pet:</i></p>
                        <p>It is every Host's and Member's responsibility to have his/her pets up to date on a form of flea and tick control. Both Members and Hosts acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any situation arises where either the Host's or the Member's pet introduces fleas/ticks, the guardian of said pet shall be held responsible for all costs associated with fleas and/or flea/tick prevention. It is the responsibility of all Members to disclose any knowledge of flea/tick issues associated with their pets to all Hosts before any Service is rendered.</p>


                        <p><strong><u>Financial Terms</u></strong></p>
                        <p>DogVacay, through its proprietary network of Hosts, arranges for the provision of the Host-Provided Services to Members, including, but not limited to temporary dog boarding, dog daycare and related services in the comfort of the Hosts' private residences. As a Host, you may create Listings, and will be asked detailed information about your place and pets (if relevant). You may set the pricing and terms for your services within the parameters permitted by the Site, however DogVacay does reserve the right to cancel any reservation that does not meet our standards for services or minimum rates, as determined in our sole discretion. For example, currently, any reservation that is not at least $10 per night for boarding and sitting, $10 per day for daycare or $10 per service for all other services will be cancelled, and we reserve the right to cancel any other reservations in our sole discretion. In the event that DogVacay does cancel a reservation for these reasons, the guest will receive a full refund, including any Service Fees. DogVacay.com charges a Service Fee of 15% to the Host to cover the costs of payment processing and Site administration. As a Host, you contractually agree that the first and all future bookings with a client from DogVacay will be booked via the Site or by calling the toll-free number. Failure to abide by this policy may result in suspension from the Site.</p>
                        <p>As a Member, you may book Host-Provided Services through the Site. DogVacay may charge a Booking Fee (determined at our sole discretion) that will be presented to the Member during the booking process. All charges, including but not limited to the subtotal and Booking Fee, shall be listed in United States Dollars (USD), including Reservations made in Canada. Upon submission of a booking, DogVacay will validate/verify (but not charge) the Member's credit card and store the Member's credit card securely in their account. The Host will be given three (3) business days to respond to the booking request or the booking request may be automatically cancelled. If the Host accepts the booking request, the full amount of the Host-Provided Service, inclusive of nightly fees, extra fees, and the DogVacay Booking Fee will be immediately charged in United States Dollars (USD) to the Member's card on file. If the booking is subsequently cancelled by the booking Member, the booking Member will be required to pay the DogVacay Booking Fee. DogVacay reserves the right to cancel any reservations for which the booking Member has not provided the required payment within 4 business days of making the reservation, at which point DogVacay will notify the Host of said cancellation. If the cancellation policy of the Host at time of booking would require the booking Member to pay all or any portion of the fees for the reservation based on when the reservation is cancelled, the booking Member will be required to pay such fees, and the Host will be entitled to such fees, less DogVacay's fees, in each case as determined at the sole discretion of DogVacay. In case of reservations that are extended beyond the initially agreed end-date, DogVacay will automatically charge the nightly fee previously arranged between host and guest, until guest dog is back in possession of guest. DogVacay will release the payment (less Service Fee) to the Host within one (1) business day, excluding federal holidays, after the end of the pet boarding stay. Hosts may select between PayPal (free) or traditional check ($5 fee) for receiving said funds. Members may remove their saved credit card information permanently from their account once their Host-Provided Services have been paid in full and have been fully rendered.</p>
                        <p>Each Host hereby appoints DogVacay as the Host's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Members on behalf of the Host. Each Host agrees that payment made by a Member to DogVacay shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the Host-Provided Services available to Member in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the applicable fees. Each Host agrees that, DogVacay may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Member to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Member that portion of the fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, DogVacay assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Cancellations and Refunds</u></strong></p>
                        <p>As a Member, you are given the flexibility to select amongst listings with differing overnight cancellation policies: namely, (a) Flexible - 100% refund with cancellation at least 4 days before the scheduled pet drop-off date, and 50% refund if cancellation occurs after that; (b) Moderate - 100% refund with cancellation at least 7 days before the scheduled pet drop-off date, and 50% refund if cancellation occurs after that; or (c) Strict - No refund after booking, except where determined by DogVacay in unusual circumstances. Cancellation under a Flexible or Moderate cancellation policy must be made by 11:59 Pacific Time in order to qualify for having occurred on a particular day. Any booking fees charged at the time of reservation are non-refundable.</p>
                        <p>For Daycare reservations, you will be entitled to receive a full refund minus any fees if you cancel 2 days prior to the start of the individual daycare session, and will be refunded 50% thereafter. For example, if the daycare session begins on 7/5, you must call by 11:59pm PST on 7/3 for a full refund. Note, the daycare cancellation policy applies separately to each individual daycare date. In other words, if you have a reservation for daycare on Wednesday and on Friday, you’ll need to cancel both separately (by 11:59pm Monday for Wednesday’s reservation; and by 11:59pm Wednesday for Friday’s reservation).</p>
                        <p>In the event that you, as a booking Member, need to change the dates of a reservation already booked through DogVacay, you will be subject to the Host's selected cancellation policy for any days cancelled. Each Member agrees to be bound by the option selected by Host and agreed to as part of the booking process. In addition, regardless of the Host's cancellation policy or when a booking is cancelled, DogVacay may charge a cancellation fee (determined at our sole discretion) that will be presented to the Member during the booking process.</p>
                        <p>After a first-time booking between Member and Host, Member and Host may, at their own discretion, arrange for a live meeting to introduce the Member's dog to the Hosts place and pets. If the result of this meeting is the determination that a dog boarding stay or other Host-Provided Service would not be in the best interests of the pets, either party may cancel the booking and all money will be refunded to Booking Member, less DogVacay's Booking Fee. Requesting member must contact DogVacay customer support at <a href="mailto:help@dogvacay.com">help@dogvacay.com</a> to request this refund.</p>
                        <p>Cancellations by Hosts are taken seriously. Each Host cancellation will be reviewed by DogVacay to determine if it is subject to an account review. We understand that emergencies happen and will take time to review each cancellation on a case-by-case basis. Hosts are expected to only accept those reservations that they are committed to completing. In the event that a Host is no longer able to provide the service, the Host must contact customer support immediately by calling&nbsp;855-364-8222.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Host cancellations within a week of the start of a reservation may result in account review.</li>
                            <li>Host cancellations within 3 days of the start date of a reservation will result in immediate account review and/or possible suspension</li>
                            <li>More than two Host cancellations within a three month period will&nbsp;result in immediate account review and/or possible suspension</li>
                            <li>Host Cancellations after the start of the Host-Provided Services that result in the guest dog's removal from the Host's home may result in account review and/or possible suspension, except in cases of severe aggression, emergency, etc., as determined at the sole discretion of DogVacay.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Home pet boarding and other Host-Provided Services are not appropriate for all pets, especially aggressive poorly socialized pets.

You expressly release and discharge Releasees from <strong>any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action whatsoever</strong> arising out of any damage, loss, personal injury or death to you and/or your children/child/ward, while the pet is boarding in your home or you otherwise provide any Host-Provided Services, except as provided in the Insurance Program. If you are a California resident, you, on behalf of yourself and/or your children/child/ward and your/their personal representatives, successors, heirs, and assigns, waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: <strong><i>"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." </i></strong>This release is valid and effective whether the damage, loss or death is a result of any <strong>act or omission </strong> on the part of any of Releasees or from any other cause. This waiver and release of all liability includes, without limitation, any injuries, illness, or accidents, which may occur as a result of the pet boarding in your home or any other Host-Provided Services, except as provided in the Insurance Program.

                        <p><strong><u>Employment and Withholding</u></strong></p>

As such, DogVacay will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social security or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of the Site. You understand and agree that if DogVacay is found to be liable for any tax or withholding tax in connection with your use of the Site, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to DogVacay an equivalent amount, including any interest or penalties thereon.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>No Agency</u></strong></p>
                        <p>No agency (except as expressly set forth herein), partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, except as expressly set forth herein, Dogvacay.com is not acting as an agent for any Host, Member or any other user or visitor of the Site.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Local Indirect Taxes</u></strong></p>
                        <p>You are responsible for complying with all applicable tax laws and regulations related to your use of the Site and Host-Provided Services. Without limiting the foregoing, each Host is responsible for determining any applicable local indirect taxes and for including such taxes or obligations related to such taxes in his or her listings.

                        <p><strong><u>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</u></strong></p>
                        <p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and DogVacay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Los Angeles County, California or a United States District Court located in Los Angeles, California for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Dispute Resolution &amp; Waiver of Jury Trial</u></strong></p>
                        <p>You and DogVacay agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Site ("Dispute"), will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Either you or DogVacay may elect to have such Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND DOGVACAY ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow the law of the State of California, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. In addition to the exclusions above, you and DogVacay may initiate action in the state or federal courts in Los Angeles County, California to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Access and Compliance" section above, if DogVacay changes this "Dispute Resolution &amp; Waiver of Jury Trial" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to help@dogvacay.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of DogVacay's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and DogVacay in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution &amp; Waiver of Jury Trial" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that you and DogVacay are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and DogVacay otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Severability</u></strong></p>
                        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.</p>

                        <p><strong><u>Miscellaneous</u></strong></p>
